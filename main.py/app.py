In this tutorial, we will understand the process of creating a multi-PDF reader Generative AI Chatbot using Open AI, LangChain libraries and Streamlit.

But before jumping into the process and code, first the libraries‚Äô basics

Open AI embeddings:
OpenAI‚Äôs text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:

Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
Open AI Models:
GPT-4, a large multimodal model that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of the Open AI previous models.

LangChain Chains libraries:
RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain- Question-answering with sources over an index. Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments. Raises Validation Error if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model.

PDF Libraries:
PyPDF2 is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files.

Web Application Library:
Streamlit: An open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.

Note : We will be using Github as our Code hosting repository.

So, Without further ado, lets jump into the code.

Create two files on GitHub:

I. main.py/app.py

II. requirements.txt

main.py/app.py
import streamlit as st
import langchain
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain import OpenAI, VectorDBQA
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain
import PyPDF2

__import__('pysqlite3')
import sys
sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')

#This function will go through pdf and extract and return list of page texts.
def read_and_textify(files):
    text_list = []
    sources_list = []
    for file in files:
        pdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        #print("Page Number:", len(pdfReader.pages))
        for i in range(len(pdfReader.pages)):
          pageObj = pdfReader.pages[i]
          text = pageObj.extract_text()
          pageObj.clear()
          text_list.append(text)
          sources_list.append(file.name + "_page_"+str(i))
    return [text_list,sources_list]

st.set_page_config(layout="centered", page_title="GoldDigger")
st.header("GoldDigger")
st.write("---")
  
#file uploader
uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Upload documents",accept_multiple_files=True, type=["txt","pdf"])
st.write("---")

if uploaded_files is None:
  st.info(f"""Upload files to analyse""")
elif uploaded_files:
  st.write(str(len(uploaded_files)) + " document(s) loaded..")
  
  textify_output = read_and_textify(uploaded_files)
  
  documents = textify_output[0]
  sources = textify_output[1]
  
  #extract embeddings
  embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key = st.secrets["openai_api_key"])
  #vstore with metadata. Here we will store page numbers.
  vStore = Chroma.from_texts(documents, embeddings, metadatas=[{"source": s} for s in sources])
  #deciding model
  model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  # model_name = "gpt-4"

  retriever = vStore.as_retriever()
  retriever.search_kwargs = {'k':2}

  #initiate model
  llm = OpenAI(model_name=model_name, openai_api_key = st.secrets["openai_api_key"], streaming=True)
  model = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)
  
  st.header("Ask your data")
  user_q = st.text_area("Enter your questions here")
  
  if st.button("Get Response"):
    try:
      with st.spinner("Model is working on it..."):
        result = model({"question":user_q}, return_only_outputs=True)
        st.subheader('Your response:')
        st.write(result['answer'])
        st.subheader('Source pages:')
        st.write(result['sources'])
    except Exception as e:
      st.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
      st.error('Oops, the GPT response resulted in an error :( Please try again with a different question.')

Now, Lets Initialize Streamlit ‚Äî Login to Streamlit via GitHub and create a new app with the Github repo.

Streamlit Login
Deploy an App on Streamlit
Wait till your app is ready. Once live, click on the settings, add your Open AI secret (this can be grabbed from you Open AI account) and Save.


Voila! Your Chatbot is ready, run the app, upload the pdfs, and ask questions. Below is a snapshot of my app running:

Hi Binay,
I wanted to know if the solution can respond with multiple answers. Let say if the answer is present in multiple documents, can it display all these results along with the main result.
